# The Great Slowdown

## Mod Purpose
This mod aims to slow down the game economy and development in Victoria 3 to more closely match historical levels. The goal is to create a more challenging and realistic progression, making industrialization, technological advancement, and economic growth take longer and require more strategic planning.

## Summary of Recent Changes
- **Construction PMs:** Rebalanced the input goods required for construction sector production methods and reduced the construction output
- **Base construction:** Reduced base construction, moved some of the base construction to tech unlocks.
- **Construction point cost:** Made it scale higher for more expensive buildings.
- **Reduced throughput:** for critical industries for development, like tools
- **AI strategy:** Changed AI construction strategy to be based of off the current tech (sins the expected cost per construction point goes down with tech)

PLANNED:
- **Golbal efficiency drop nad consumption increase:** All PMs have their final profit reduced by 20% while their outputs increase by 20% and inputs adjust accordingly (more than 20% lol). This is to simulate each building outputing more (sins they employ too many people now imo) while slowing down the investment pool and SOL growth.
